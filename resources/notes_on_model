ex:intrinsicCategory represents the intrinsic category. This will be of type dqv:Category and be related to each of the dimensions within this category. 
ex:mappingConsistency represents the mapping consistency dimension. This will be of type dqv:Dimension.
ex:predicateShape is the SHACL shape, which is also a metric. This will be type dqv:Metric and sh:NodeShape.
ex:predicateShapeProperty is the properties of this shape, the constraints to be validated. 
ex:shapesDoc represents the file with the SHACL shapes.
ex:mapDoc is the mapping document. This will be of type prov:Entity and be related to a location.
ex:qualityAssessment is the process of assessing the mapping and generating the validation report.
ex:SHACLengine is the software running the SHACL constraints. This will be of type prov:SoftwareAgent and be related to software information etc. 
ex:validationReport is the SHACL validation report. This will be of type sh:ValidationReport and prov:Entity. This will contain information on violations. 
ex:violation is a violation contain within the SHACL report. This will be of type sh:ValidationResult and prov:Entity. This will relate to information about the violation. 
ex:confidenceScore is the score of how confident the framework is that the refinement will remove the violation. This is of type dqv:QualityMeasurement and prov:Entity 
and is a measurement of the confident score metric. The score is represented as a double value.
ex:confidenceScoreMetric is the metric used to calculate the confidence score. This is of type dqv:Metric and expects a double value. 
ex:refinement is the suggested refinement. This is of type prov:Activity and will be related to a SPARQL query, which is the suggested refinement.
ex:SPARQLquery is the SPARQL query for the refinement. This is of type prov:Entity and will be stored in a prov:Location. 
ex:refinedMapDoc is the refined mapping document, generated from the refinement activity. This is of type prov:Entity and will be stored in a prov:Location.
